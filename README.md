# Flappy Bird Game

The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby automatically descends and only ascends when the user press UP-key . Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player two point. Colliding with a pipes, ground or the top ends the game. After some every level the speed also increase and the difficulty as well.
